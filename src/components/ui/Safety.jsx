            Safety measures to help you while traveling During covid-19

          <p>
            Covid-19 isn&apos;t over yet, and we are again on edge facing new
            variants of the virus. However, the world cannot stop, and neither
            can traveling. So we have taken up a few important and impactful
            measures to keep our customers safe and secure when traveling with
            us:

            <p>
              Sanitization is the first step we have followed since the Covid-19
              outbreak. It is because we understand how important sanitization
              is to protect ourselves from the deadly virus. So, after every
              drive, we sanitize our vehicles to make them safe for our next
              ride.

              We understand the importance of knowing when a person is affected
              by Covid-19. However, even a slight delay can spread the virus
              among the masses. So, for your and our driver&apos;s safety, we
              ensure our drivers get their body temperatures checked at least
              thrice a day
