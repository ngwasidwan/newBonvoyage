        <h1 className="intro-heading">What are tolls and tool booths?</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          An amount paid for the right to cross a road, bridge, or gate is
          referred to as a toll. Tolls have been there since the middle ages. It
          is a tax that you pay for various means of transportation to travel on
          a particular roadway infrastructure. For example, a car pays a toll to
          travel on a highway road, while a ship does the same to cross a
          channel.

          liable for a fine. So, make your toll payments and enjoy a hassle-free
          tour. Cash, credit card, electronic transponder, and online license
          plate registration are a few payment modes.

          Some drivers prefer to travel with cash to pay tolls. But, at the
          moment, there are limited cash toll booths. The number of cash toll

          Whenever you pass through these booths, a camera will read the
          transponder on your windshield. The camera will capture the license
          plate number of the car if there is no transponder. If you are in a
          rental car and don’t have a transponder, the toll bill will be sent to
          the rental company. The company will forward that amount to you

          The charges for hiring a rental car vary from company to company. Some

          When driving a rental car, you should drop the idea of running away

          Many customers do not think of toll roads when hiring a rental car,

          for the tolls and daily charges for using the company’s transponder.
