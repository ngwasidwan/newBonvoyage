          Renting a car for leisure or work has its own advantages. It provides
          the convenience of exploring new places without waiting for public
          transportation. Are you planning an adventurous cross-country road
          trip? If yes, we know how excited you are. But hold on! You are not
          sure if you can take a rental car out of state. You will first have to
          go through the car rental agreement, as some companies may not allow
          you to take the rental car out of state
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Generally, if you rent a car from a small car rental company, they
          have limited locations. They do not allow the drivers to take rental
          cars out of state because they are not equipped to offer some
          necessary things. For instance, once the customer crosses the state
          border, they are confined to offering roadside emergency assistance to
          the customer. However, bigger rental car companies will allow
          out-of-state travel but with some restrictions.

          {"'What happens if you take a rental car out of state.'"} We discusses
          things that will help you avoid fees and restrictions.

          When You Cannot Take Your Rental Car Out Of State?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Generally, there are three scenarios in which you cannot take your
          rental car out of state. Gratefully, these are rare scenarios and only
          applicable in specific circumstances.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          For instance, mileage limitations, geographic restrictions, and
          specific location rules. These things may stop you from taking a
          rental car out of state.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          {" Let's"} dive deeper into the reasons that may stop you from taking
          a rental car out of state.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Mileage Limitations</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Suppose the car rental company provides limited mileage and does not
          offer unlimited mileage. The limitation might be over if you take the
          car out of state.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          However, rental companies that provide unlimited mileage allow you to
          take the car across state lines. But may charge an additional fee if
          you drive the car out of state.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Geographic Restrictions</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Few car rental companies may not allow you to take the car beyond
          certain geographic restrictions. It can be a state, country, or
          geographic region. However, it depends on the car rental company and
          the pickup spot.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Remember, do not take all this for granted, as you cannot get away
          from all this because the rental cars have GPS tracking.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          If you violate geographical restrictions, you may have to pay hefty
          fees. Moreover, having a lack of liability coverage or insurance
          during an accident will lead you to pay the entire cost of the
          vehicle.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">specific-location rules</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Some states and locations have more stringent rental car regulations.
          If you rent a car, you may not be allowed to leave the rental state or
          the island from which the car was rented.

          Things To Consider When Renting A Car For Out Of State Travel
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          What other things must you consider to take a rental vehicle out of
          state? Below are some important points you must consider before you
          plan to drive a rental car to another state.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Beware Of One-Way Car Rental Drop Charges
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          You might have to pay a hefty charge for one-way dropping because you
          pick up the car from one location and drop it off at another. Before
          renting a car, get a written confirmation about the one-way drop
          charge.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Be Comfortable With Other Vehicle Classes
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          In some situations, a rental car company will not allow you to drive
          large vehicle classes (for example, SUVs, exotic cars, or large cargo
          vans) after a mileage limitation is set. It makes taking the vehicle
          across the state lines impossible without paying the charge. If you
          are comfortable renting a smaller vehicle class, you will not face
          this problem.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Go Through Your Rental Agreement</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          On your rental agreement, there is some fine print that you have to
          read carefully. It will be better that you go through the terms and
          conditions that are mentioned on the website of the rental car
          company.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Do Not Ignore The Rules</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          It can be thrilling when you ignore the rules and drive the vehicle
          across the state lines. But you cannot take the rental car out of
          state after some time. Even the rental cars have GPS trackers
          installed, and now you may be charged a heavy fine. Suppose you get
          into an accident around the state lines where you should not be. You
          may be liable for violating the rules and for damages.

          but some may charge additional fees for crossing the state or country
          border. So, if you wish to take the car out of state, ask the rental

          If you are planning to take the vehicle out of state, do not forget to
          inform the rental car company. Yes, there can be situations where the
          rental car company may tell you to pay an extra fee for crossing the
          border. Even some rental car companies may not allow you to go out of
          state. But you can secure yourself from paying high penalties for any
          damage.

          mileage. Find those rental car companies that follow this policy for
          out-of-state travel. Also, you may have to pay an extra charge if you
          do not follow the limitations.

        <h1 className="sub-heading">Look For Discounts</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          If you want to rent a car out of state, check for coupons or
          discounts. Once you have booked the vehicle, do not hesitate to make
          changes if you find some other vehicle at a lower price or want to
          change the route.

          The answer to what happens if you take a rental car out of state
          depends on various factors. These factors include the car rental

          out of state, and many more. However, to avoid paying extra charges
          and penalties, the best choice is to make the rental company aware of
          your intent to drive the car to another state.
