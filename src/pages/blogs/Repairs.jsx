          Renting a car for travel can be fun, but what if it breaks down in the
          middle of your journey? Car breakdowns can happen anywhere, anytime.
          No matter what type of car rental you have booked, breakdowns are
          quite possible. But what should you do if your car stops working in
          the middle of your journey? If you are also finding an answer to the
          question,
          {"let's"} find it together.

          How You Should React In A Rental Car Breakdown?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Breakdowns are frustrating and can take your entire day. If you are
          traveling with your family, you want everybody to be safe. Here are
          the steps that you need to take in an event like breakdown:
        </p>

        <h2 className="sub-heading">Contact for help</h2>
        <p className="text">
          During a car rental breakdown, you might be stopped in an area that is
          deserted or unfamiliar to you. Also, it may be late at night, making
          you feel more unsafe. So, you call 911 for help. You can also call on
          your
          {"insurer's"} roadside assistance phone number.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          If the breakdown happens in a populated and safe area, and there is
          nobody injured, then you might not have to call 911. When everything
          is safe, contact the rental company and then a tow truck if needed.
        </p>
        <h2 className="sub-heading">Do an inspection of the rental car</h2>
        <p className="text">
          Inspect the rental car to check the site where the breakdown has
          happened. If there is a technical malfunction, {"you'll"} convince the
          rental company that you {"weren't"} responsible for that and{" "}
          {"mustn't"} be held liable for paying the repair costs.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          With your {"phone's"} camera, click the pictures of the damaged or
          broken parts (if visible). Furthermore, if your negligent driving is
          the reason for the breakdown, there may be chances you will be held
          liable to pay for damages.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          <span className="text-red-500">Remember:</span> This may not be the
          case if the breakdown happens in a potentially hazardous area. Also,
          no need to put yourself at risk if you cannot take the pictures
          safely.
        </p>
        <h1 className="intro-heading">
          Who pays for the repairs in a rental car breakdown?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          In most cases, the renter itself is liable to pay for the damages in a
          rental car breakdown. If the renter {"doesn't"} possess any additional
          coverage for the rental car, they are likely to be liable for paying
          the damages. But if they have added coverage, it may cover the rental
          car breakdowns. So they do not need to panic about paying for the
          damages in such an incident.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          A majority of rental contracts possess only basic insurance coverage
          for damage, theft, and third-party damages. Breakdowns are generally
          not covered in this insurance plan. The rental car service provider
          will later charge the renter for any recovery, repair, or roadside
          assistance.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          It is possible to get a rental contract that incorporates coverage for
          breakdowns. However, these are very rare to find.
        </p>
        <h1 className="intro-heading">
          How Can A Renter Add Breakdown Coverage To Their Rental Car
          Reservation?
        </h1>

        <p className="text">
          Breakdown coverage is generally a part of a bigger insurance package.
          A renter can add it to their rental car reservation at extra cost. You
          might not be able to select the elements of the insurance packages.
          Thus, it is complicated to include only the breakdown coverage in your
          rental agreement.
        </p>

        <p className="text">
          Most rental agencies provide their customers with breakdown coverage.
          They offer it as a part of their added insurance plans.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          It is all up to the renter. While renting a car, it is not legally
          mandatory to add breakdown coverage or extra cover to your booking.
        </p>

          What Are The Ways To Prevent A Rental Car Breakdown?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Negligence of the driver is one of the reasons for the most common
          types of rental car breakdown. Leaving the keys inside the car,
          filling the wrong fuel, and damaging the gearbox are a few common
          causes. Here are some useful tips to prevent a breakdown:
        </p>
        <h1 className="intro-heading">Drive With Complete Safety</h1>
        <p className="text">
          The driving habits of the driver will affect the vehicle. It is
          important to have good driving habits, or else your rental car health
          will be compromised. Just stay focused on the road, maintain a safe
          distance between other vehicles, and {"don't"} exceed the speed limit.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Keep all this in mind, and you will refrain yourself from driving
          recklessly. Also, try to avoid late braking and overloading the car.
        </p>
        <h1 className="intro-heading">Check The {"Tires'"} Condition</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Before getting on the wheels, check for any flat tire, or else you may
          face a problem. If you find any signs of a flat tire in your rental
          car, ask your service provider to replace it.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Moreover, it is important to check whether there are any over-inflated
          tires, as they are more susceptible to damage. Over-inflated tires can
          result in heat-ups and even bursts. Ensure that your car rental
          provider gives you vehicles that have tires in the finest condition.
        </p>
        <h1 className="intro-heading">
          What Is The Breakdown Cost Charged By A Rental Company?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          A car rental service provider may charge the driver for a breakdown
          after the end of their rental period. The cost might differ on the
          basis of the problem. For example, fixing a flat battery or flat tire
          is pocket-friendly. But, other problems like wrong fuel fill or
          damaged clutch are quite costly. Below, we have mentioned some
          examples of breakdown costs that rental companies often charge:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-box">
          <li>Damaged clutch -$797 to $888</li>
          <li>Flat battery- $121 to $134</li>
          <li>Putting the wrong fuel- $481 to $816</li>
          <li>Damaged or lost keys- $158 to $ 657</li>
          <li>Flat tyre- $170 to $353</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="conclusion">Conclusion</p>
        <p className="text">
          Rental cars often go through technical malfunctions, and this can
          result in a breakdown. So, most of the car-renting companies are
          offering car rentals with breakdown coverage. But, when it comes to
          the reimbursement of a rental car breakdown repairs, one of the key
          things considered is
          {"who is liable."} Some car rental companies provide breakdown
