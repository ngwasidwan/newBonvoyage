          What If You Crash a Rental Car Without Insurance?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Generally, when you rent a car, a rental car company provides you with
          a temporary insurance plan. As this offer is out of budget for many
          people, they just hope that nothing gets wrong and do not opt for this
          option. Another question you may have is whether your auto insurance
          covers a rental.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Keep in mind that if you are trying to save some money by not opting
          for the insurance, it may badly affect you in the long run. For
          instance, if you crash a rental car without insurance, you have to be
          ready for future consequences.

          Things You Have to Do If You Get in a Rental Car Accident
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          What should I do if I find myself in a rental car accident? Well, the
          question is one of the common questions asked over the web. Whether
          you have insurance or not, these few tips may be helpful for you in
          case of a rental car accident.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Is Anyone Injured In An Accident?</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          First, you have to check if there is anyone who is injured in an
          accident. If anyone is injured, immediately call 911. It should be the
          first thing you must do whether or not you have auto insurance.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Do You Need To Report The Police?</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Reporting the police about the rental car accident is one of the
          essential things to do. The report can be your powerful asset if you
          want to file any claim with your insurance company. The police will go
          through all the facts about where the accident happened and find who
          was at fault. Make sure that you ask for a copy after the police
          officer has filed the report.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">inform everyone who was involved</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Until the police arrive at the location, they exchange the contact and
          insurance information with everyone who was involved at that time.
          Exchange the information from one another and, if possible, collect
          the information from any witnesses.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          click pictures and collect all the evidence
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Ensure that you have collected everything. Click pictures of the
          damaged rental car and the {"accident's"} location. If there are
          scratches, take pictures and mention them. Make sure nothing is left,
          and click every small detail that may affect you in the future.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Contact The Car Rental Company</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Now, contact the rental car company to inform them about the incident.
          Also, you should have an emergency number from the rental company. Ask
          them what you have to do if the car is drivable, and if not, ask them
          to get it towed.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Ensure to note the name of the person you talked to and the date and
          time for your records.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">contact your insurance company</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Suppose you do not have insurance from the rental car company. Now you
          have to contact your personal auto insurance as soon as possible. Do
          not be late in claiming the insurance. It is important to look at your
          insurance policy to ensure it covers a rental car before you pass on
          the insurance offer.{" "}

          What Happens When The Car Crash Was Not Your Fault?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          You still have to inform the rental company if you {"didn't"} cause
          the car crash and it {"wasn't"} your fault. They may file a claim or
          ask you to file a claim with a third-party insurance company. It is
          generally known as a third-party claim. If the rental car company
          tells you to pay for any damages after all this, then you may need to
          involve your lawyer.{" "}

        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Coverage Options You Have For A Rental Car Crash
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          When you get a rental car, it is your responsibility if any loss or
          damage happens to the vehicle. Moreover, if you are not responsible
          for the damage, you will still be liable till the rental period is not
          over. But, if you have any coverage plan, it can help you with the
          damage.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Below are some of the coverage options you can purchase when you rent
          a car:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Personal Auto Insurance</h1>
        <p className="text">
          If you have your personal auto insurance plan, you can use it as
          rental car coverage. Mostly, your auto insurance is similar to rental
          car company insurance.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Before renting a car, check your auto insurance to see if it covers
          rental car crashes. If not, then be smart and buy additional insurance
          through your rental company.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Coverage Of Rental Car Company</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Usually, the car rental company offers you an additional coverage plan
          when you book a rental car. However, insurance is optional and depends
          on whether you want to purchase it.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Below are the four types of coverage options that a rental car company
          offers:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">loss damage waiver (LDW)</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Loss Damage Waiver protects you when the rental car is damaged or
          stolen. The car rental company will be liable to cover any replacement
          or repair costs. Usually, a loss damage waiver {"doesn't"} cover
          damage caused due to unauthorized drivers or reckless driving.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Personal Accident Insurance</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Personal accident cover provides coverage to the injured driver or the
          passengers at the time of an accident.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Supplemental Liability Coverage</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Supplemental liability coverage pays for the medical cost and damage
          to the property if another driver causes the accident.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Personal Effects Coverage</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          This insurance covers any damage or personal property that you have in
          the rental car. Oftentimes, you can purchase this insurance from the
          homeowners or renters insurance.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Credit Card Rental Insurance</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Often, you get rental car insurance from a credit card. If you use a
          credit card, you might get this insurance. There are chances that the
          credit card provider may pay the coverage for the damage while you
          have the car.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          There is less chance that a credit covers liability coverage. You have
          to ensure whether the credit card covers the rental coverage or not.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          What Does Auto Personal Car Coverage Cover?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Having auto personal car coverage is the first option to get
          protection for the rented car. Make sure that you never drive a
          vehicle without insurance. It provides liability coverage for damages
          you may cause to another person in an accident. If you {"don't"} own a
          car and {"don't"} have car insurance. In that case, you should
          purchase an insurance {"company's"}
          annual or temporary insurance coverage.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          If you want to protect your rental car, your auto personal coverage
          should have collision insurance. (It covers the damage to your car
          that happens in an accident with another vehicle, rollover, or
          object). Another one is comprehensive coverage( it covers those
          damages that are caused by causes that are not related to collision).
          These can be floods, theft, fallen branches to trees, etc. Third is
          the Collision Damage Waiver, a type of additional coverage offered to
          the renters.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          From these coverages, if you have one, then call one of the
          representatives of your insurance provider and ask for all the details
          of your policy.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Is There Any Coverage For Third-Party Drivers Under Collision Damage?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Rental Car companies provide a variety of options to secure a rental
          vehicle. There is one insurance that is essential to take, and the
          other ones are optional. It depends on for which purpose you rent the
          car, how much you can spend and more!
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">CDW and LDW</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Collision Damage Waiver, or Loss Damage Waiver coverage, covers
          damages like accidents or thefts during the rental period. You can get
          these coverages with and without a franchise. Insurance companies
          providing coverage with franchises are responsible for covering a
          specific amount. However, insurance without a franchise is the
          responsibility of the insurer to cover all the damages.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Are you wondering about what CDW coverage does not cover? And what LDW
          coverage does not cover? CDW and LDW do not cover third-party damages.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          It is essential to understand that {"insurers'"} coverage is
          invalidated in situations where the renter has shown carelessness in
          handling the rental car. These situations can be driving under the
          influence of alcohol, loading the wrong fuel, etc.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          The average cost of additional insurance is $27-$30/day when the
          coverage is directly purchased from the rental car company counter.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Who Is Responsible For The Damage In A Rental Car?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          When you are driving a rental car and cause an accident, you are
          legally accountable for that. But, if you possess coverage, your
          insurance provider should cover the damages. That is why it is
          essential to know all the coverage options available.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Unless you have violated your rental car coverage, the rental
          insurance company will cover the damages caused by an accident. But,
          coverage may get affected by an area, and you may be responsible for
          the damage. If you do not have rental coverage, then your personal
          auto insurance coverage must cover the cost.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Can A Car Rental Company Be Responsible To Pay For The Damage?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Even though most rental cars come with coverage without a franchise
          and will provide you security in different situations, there can be
          some possibilities that you may run out of coverage. For example,
          after an accident, if it is proven that you were driving the car under
          some prohibited substances like alcohol or drugs. In that case, no
          insurance will cover the damages, and the renter must pay.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          There are some other damages that insurance will not cover, such as
          filling the {"car's"} tank with the wrong fuel, you have lost the
          keys, and more. In general, all these things are obvious negligence.
          Suppose the rental car company proves to be guilty of renting a
          vehicle with mechanical problems. The car rental company should be
          held accountable for the damage.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Do You Need A Lawyer To File A Claim After The Accident?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          After you have experienced an accident in a rental car(and suffering
          from back pain, broken bones, or some internal injuries), the
          compensation will be put on hold unless the damage amount is not
          identified. Usually, the rental car company is answerable between 30
          to 60 days, even though it could be less.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          If the claim does not pass, you have the insurance by a third
          party(your credit card, personal policy, or other outside car
          insurer). Remember, usually, this insurance does not work like other
          policies. At first, you will have to pay whatever the amount is, and
          then you ask for the claim.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          When you get into an accident and do not have car rental insurance,
          you must seek help from a Lawyer. Get an experienced lawyer who can
          help in rental car accidents. If you have a personal injury lawyer,
          they can help you know whether you will get any compensation.
        </p>
        <p className="conclusion">Conclusion</p>
        <p className="text">
          Car Insurance is important as it covers any cost of rental car damage
          from a crash. If someone crashes a rental car, they will be
          responsible for covering the damage costs. Damages can be expensive
          sometimes, and they can be difficult to deal with. Insurance makes it
          easier to deal with these types of situations.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Rental Car Coverage is always a reliable option to get out of a
          difficult situation. Before renting a car, always research and know
