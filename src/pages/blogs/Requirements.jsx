          However, when you know the requirements, the confidence to head
          towards the counter desk and pick up the keys is different. {"Let's"}{" "}
          dive into this blog and understand{" "}
          {"What are the requirements for renting a car?"} Go through all the
          requirements before you rent a car.{" "}

        <h1 className="intro-heading">Things You Need Before Renting A Car</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          When you rent a car for the first time, it feels like a daunting
          experience as hidden charges, insurance options, and mileage policies
          can change your mood. It may force you to travel by air or train. But
          it gets simplified when you know the car renting process and what
          things are required. Below are some of the things you need before you
          rent a car:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Minimum Age Requirement </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Several car rental companies have set a minimum age for their
          vehicles. Generally, when you rent a car, your age should be at least
          25 years old. If the company age is set to a minimum between 21- 24,
          it will charge additional fees from you. Moreover, if the age of the
          driver is 18, then it depends on the state law whether they will allow
          them to rent a car.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">requirement of documents</h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          You may have to show some documents, like the original {"driver's"}{" "}
          license and debit or credit card, but that should be active. In
          addition, some rental companies may tell you to provide a good driving
          record.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Insurance Coverage </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          When you rent a car, you have to make sure that you consider the
          consequences of an accident or theft, which is mentioned in the car
          rental agreement. Car insurance offers protection against unnecessary
          expenses. But you should know that your policy covers rental coverage.
          If your policy {"doesn't"} cover rental cars, you have the option to
          buy it from a car rental company.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">{"Driver's"} License </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          You will surely need a {"driver's"} license before you rent a car. A
          {"driver's"} license confirms that you are a legal driver and is also
          proof of your age. Commonly, your age should be at least 25 years old
          to rent a car. However, in the U.S., the minimum age is 21 to rent a
          car. The drivers aged between 21 and 24 have to pay the additional
          rental fee. Even some car rental companies may ask you to provide the
          same state license where the rental location is.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Credit Card Should Be Active </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Even when you have a {"driver's"} license, the renting process will
          get paused if you {"don't"} have an active credit card. Most car
          rental companies {"don't"} accept debit cards, even though they have
          the logo of credit cards like Master card or Visa. An active credit
          card by the name of the driver is important because the car rental
          company put the card on hold for insurance purposes.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">How You Can Rent A Car? (Best Tips) </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          When you rent a car, it provides you with several benefits while
          traveling. A rented car provides flexibility and freedom, and you can
          travel comfortably without any restrictions. If {"it's"} your first
          time, here are some tips that you can apply while renting a car:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Avoid Booking Car Rentals At Airports </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          If possible, avoid renting the car from the airport. The charges will
          be high if you rent a car from the airport. It is because they will
          pick you up right after your flight and drop you off on time for your
          departure flight. Some renters look for convenience, and the high
          charges are worth the price, but for some renters, {"it's"} not.
          Usually, car rental offices that are located inside the cities have
          prices on the lower side. So, first, consider the options. If they are
          worth the money, then only rent it.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">You Might Not Need The Car Insurance </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Car rental companies try to convince the customer to buy something
          additional. One of these additional purchases includes car insurance.
          The insurance process starts from the booking time and will continue
          until you pick up your car. Sometimes, renters politely refuse to get
          any insurance, and the company does not take it further.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          However, other times, when you refuse the insurance, they warn you.
          They tell you that if any scratch or damage happens to the car, it
          will protect you from fines and penalties. These tactics are just one
          way to sell more insurance. Generally, this happens with the smaller
          car rental companies. However, it all depends on the location.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Moreover, if you have an auto insurance policy, it may cover the
          liability for a car rental. Call your insurance provider and check
          whether it is covered or not.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Keep The Right Card With You </h1>
        <p className="text">
          The right way to rent a car is with a credit card. Usually, many car
          rental companies accept payments from credit cards as it helps them
          check credit availability. In addition, it also helps them to easily
          hold the estimated cost of rental and security deposit without any
          issue.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          There are many ways in which payments done by credit cards help the
          renters:{" "}

        <p className="last-text">
          Thinking of how to rent a car? Make sure that you complete your
          homework first. The best you can do is rent a car online. Before we
          reserve a rental car, you first have to search online. Generally, the
          process will start with discovering cars and comparing the prices on
          the website. It helps to get an idea of the rental {"car's"} exact
          cost and where you can get lower prices.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Check For Reviews</h1>
        <p className="text">
          One of the best tips before renting a car is to carefully check the
          reviews. Read what the customer said about a particular car. Remember
          that reviewers get easily pissed off in many situations. Reviews like
          they have been extra charged or GPS has an up-charge. The best thing
          is to disregard these reviews when renting a car.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          You should be more concerned about quality of service, cleanliness,
          customer service, and more! So, if you see negative reviews related to
          all or any of these things, you know you have to shift to another
          rental company website. It is just that you have to do your research
          carefully.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Select The Vehicle Of Your Choice </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Car rental companies offer you a wide variety of vehicles to choose
          from. Make sure that you keep your driving style and budget in mind
          before you select the car.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Check the vehicle carefully before you sign all the documents. Does
          the car have any dents or scratches? Does the interior of the car is
          clean, or seats are clean? Inspect the car with your agent.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Ensure To Fill The Tank By Yourself </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          You drop off the car, and the car rental agency fills the tank. Seems
          very convenient, right? Hold on! {"Don't"} make a fool of yourself.
          You have to pay for that later on, and that can be costly compared to
          the actual price. When you pick the car, they give you a tank full.
          Ensure you plan some extra time when you can fill the tank before you
          return the car.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">How Much Is The Cost Of A Rental Car? </h1>
