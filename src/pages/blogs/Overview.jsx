          Are you someone who is looking to travel within or outside various
          states? If you are, then you must be wary of car rentals that let you
          drive out of state. In a majority of cases, you are allowed to take
          your rented car outside the state and go across the country without
          paying any extra charge. Excluding some, many car rental providers
          offer out-of-state travel. This is because there are lots of customers
          who rent vehicles for traveling outside the stage for a vacation or
          business.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          When you hire a car rental, make sure that you are wary of specific
          rules and regulations of the company on crossing borders or state
          boundaries. Different car rental companies have varying policies that
          indicate whether they meet your requirements or not.

          Car Rentals Offering Out-Of-State Services
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          There may be car rentals that offer out-of-state travel, while some
          may not. So, to know that, we have created a list of “what car rental
          companies allow out-of-state travel.” Let’s take a quick look at them:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Bon Voyage Car Rental</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Bon Voyage Car Rental is among the leading car rental providers you
          can prefer for long trips or travel outside the state. Customers hire
          Bon Voyage rental cars to have the most enjoyable experience for their
          next tour.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          The past customers have appreciated their out-of-state rental
          services. They have a transparent and hassle-free renting process. You
          can also select from various options, like economy cars and SUV cars.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          So, if you are looking to explore new places within and outside the
          state, count on Bon Voyage without a hitch. The rental company also
          offers discount offers for which you have to stay updated.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">FOX Rent A Car</h1>
        <p className="text">
          If you are seeking rental car companies for out-of-state trips, FOX
          Rent A Car can be an excellent choice. FOX offers both one-way trips
          and travel across several states.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          If you go for the one-way trip option, you may have to pay an extra
          charge that may range anywhere from $20 to $500. Once you have paid
          this amount, you will be entitled to out-of-state travel. You can drop
          the rented car at the available office within your destination state.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          However, this option is restricted to states like Washington, Arizona,
          Utah, Nevada, and California. It means you can only travel outside the
          state if your rental car company originates from any of these states.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          There are also some restrictions to choose the second option. It
          implies that you can only drive from and to states like California,
          Oregon, Arizona, Nebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and many others.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">SixT</h1>
        <p className="text">
          SixT Rental is another renowned car rental company. You can book their
          cars for driving outside the state after signing the contract for
          out-of-state travel. This also depends on the state from where you are
          booking the rental and the type of car. Some cars are not permitted to
          drive outside the state.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">

          other car rental providers.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Budget</h1>

          Budget allows the customers to take the rented cars outside the state.

          the go-to destination. Nearly every Budget outlet in the country
          allows out-of-state trips. Only about 5 % of the budget outlets don’t
          offer out-of-state travel for rental cars. There might be certain
          conditions or specifications that these outlets have
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Herts</h1>
        <p className="text">
          If you are looking for car rentals for travel outside the state, Hertz

          from Hertz Rental. As per the policy of Hertz, the majority of their
          cars have a standard unlimited mileage. This is highly important if
          you want to take the vehicle for a long trip or out of state.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          You may expect to pay a higher amount for a Hertz car if you are
          planning an out-of-state trip. In addition, the company’s policies may
          differ from location to location. Hertz has outlets in over 4,000
          locations all around Europe.

        <h1 className="sub-heading">Enterprise</h1>

        <h1 className="intro-heading">
          Reasons You May Not Be Allowed To Take A Rental Car Out Of State
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Here are some of the key reasons you might not be able to travel
          outside the state in a rental car:
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Mileage Limitations</h1>
        <p className="text">
          If your car rental doesn’t offer you unlimited mileage, you may go
          beyond the limitation by going outside the state in your rented car.
          If the distance is not far enough, you can cross state boundaries and
          stay within the mileage limit.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Car rental companies offering unlimited mileage don’t mind if the
          renters take their cars outside the state lines. However, those having
          mileage limitations might ask for an extra fee to drive beyond the
          limit.{" "}
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">Location-Centric Rules</h1>
        <p className="text">
          In states like Alaska and Hawaii, there are stringent rules and
          regulations on taking rented cars outside the state. Generally, you
          are not allowed to take a rented car from a rental location in a state
          outside of the continental US. It also includes the island from where
          it was rented.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          In other instances, hiring a car rental in a city like Las Vegas may
          bind you to further rental rules. These include those that restrict
          you from driving to states that don’t share borders with the pickup
          location state.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">geographic restrictions</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Some car rental providers may forbid driving their vehicle past a
          definite geographic location. This location can be a country, state,
          or any province.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          Think twice before violating these rules, as almost every rental
          vehicle comes with GPS tracking now. If you take the car rental beyond
          the specified geographic location, be ready to pay a hefty penalty.
          Also, your insurance coverage might not be approved in the case of an
          accident, and you’ll be liable for the whole replacement cost of the
          vehicle.
        </p>
