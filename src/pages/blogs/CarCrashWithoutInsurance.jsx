        <h1 className="intro-heading">What is auto insurance</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Personal auto insurance is a compulsory requirement of a majority of
          states in the US. It gives the holder some financial security in
          unfortunate events like accidents. It is a contract between the
          policyholder and the insurer protecting you against any fiscal loss
          due to an accident or theft. The insurer assures you they will
          compensate you for the losses as agreed upon in your policy. But you
          have to pay a monthly premium.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          What does it cover? A basic auto insurance policy offers coverage for
          property damage, bodily injury, and medical expenses.
        </p>

        <h1 className="sub-heading">What is rental car insurance?</h1>
        <p className="text">
          Rental insurance is another protection coverage plan that protects you
          and the rented vehicle in complex situations. Many car rental service
          providers do not demand rental insurance before the clients hire a car
          for rent. In addition, some provide rental insurance and other
          protection products.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          How much does this insurance plan cost? Are you looking to purchase
          optional rental insurance and protection products from a service
          provider? Then, the cost may differ depending on the vehicle type and
          many other factors.

          What are the major reasons behind a rental accident?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          Over the years, there has been an increase in the number of rental
          cars. This has inevitably resulted in increasing traffic accidents in
          rented vehicles. Here are some of the biggest reasons for rental
          accidents:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-box">
          <li>Over speeding</li>
          <li>Driving under the intoxication of drugs or alcohol</li>
          <li>
            Not checking the rental vehicle properly before taking the keys
          </li>
          <li>Not following the traffic rules</li>
          <li>Using a cell phone while driving</li>
          <li>Ignoring the pedestrians</li>
        </ul>

          Rental Car Damage When You {"Don't"} Have an Insurance
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          No doubt, renting a car is quite risky. Your exposure to road risks
          starts as you grab the car keys and sit in the {"driver's"} seat. If
          you already possess car insurance, you must speak to your insurance
          provider and file a claim. Your coverage plan may extend to your
          rental insurance up to your policy limitations. {"Don't"} have
          coverage at all? Thinking of what will happen?
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          You Might Have To Purchase A Replacement Car Forcefully
        </h1>

        <p className="last-text">
          If you wrecked your rented car severely, there is a chance you have to
          purchase a replacement car forcefully. A great majority of rented cars
          cost around $20 to $40. So, you may get into big trouble when you have
          an accident and {"don't"} have accident coverage. So, it is wise to
          buy the most appropriate accident coverage plan. With this, you can
          breathe a sigh of relief.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          The rental company may file a case against you
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          If the rental car accident is your fault, you might also be
          responsible for injuries due to the car crash. Most states let the
          drivers file a claim against each other for damages sustained in an
          accident.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Therefore, if you are found guilty of a car crash and {"don't"} have
          insurance coverage, you will pay the damages. This is when the court
          makes an unfavorable judgment against you.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          This can entail obligations for the other {"party's"} physical
          injuries, as well as medical costs, lost earnings, and other expenses.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          It {"won't"} matter if you were driving in a fault or no-fault region.
          This is because the difference between no-fault and fault
          jurisdictions would only be applicable when you have insurance. If you
          are driving with no coverage, you {"won't"} have a car insurance
          company to claim a reimbursement. You are responsible for whatever
          damage you cause out of your own pocket.
        </p>

          You May Have to Pay For the Rental Expenses
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          {"You'll"} be in great financial loss if you are involved in a mishap
          like an accident and wreck of your rented vehicle. This is most
          probably when you {"don't"} have rental insurance coverage. This may
          be costly, and you must avoid it at all costs. If you {"can't"} bear
          the cost of rental car repairs, it would be good to have rental
          insurance before getting onto the wheels.

          Is There a Need to File a Police Report After a Rental Car Accident?
        </h1>
        <p className="last-text">
          Reporting the rental car accident to the police is what you should do
          as early as possible. No matter whether you have endured minor or
          major damages. A police report can be a valuable piece of information
          that you should file with your insurer. It will state the details of
          the incident and decide who was liable for the crash. {"Don't "}forget
          to request a copy of the report after the police official documents
          it.
        </p>
        <h1 className="sub-heading">
          Can The Rental Company be Proven At-Fault?
        </h1>
        <p className="text">
          There is a vast number of rental vehicles hired with an insurance
          cover. They safeguard the driver in various consequences, including
          situations where you might run out of insurance.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          For instance, an accident happens when you are driving under the
          influence of alcohol, and it is proven. In such a situation, you{" "}
          {"won't"}
          be liable to get coverage for the losses. Moreover, your rental
          company will charge a full amount of damages.
        </p>
        <p className="last-text">
          The negligence of the contract holder, like fueling the car with the
          wrong fuel or losing keys, is another damage that insurance {"won't"}{" "}
          cover. Sometimes, a rental company may deliver you a car with
          mechanical problems. So, they can be held liable for the damage if you
          submit a claim.
